# Personal Web Portfolio
My personal portfolio website for web projects showcasing projects and skills. 

The purpose of this project is to display my work and experiences in web development.

## About the project.

This is a portfolio site to serve as a display of several personal/collaboration projects throughout my carreer.

This project includes these pages:

**- Home**
  
The main page of this website, showing summary of my developer profile to invite people in. This page includes an About Me section where the summary is located, and a Skills section showing a list of skills defined in a file and my level of proficiency on each, accompanied with a selector to filter each type of skill added.

**- Projects**

The project page is where my projects are showcased with links to access a demo of the project (if available) and its respective github repository to show the code. The projects are imported form a projectList file and displayed in card items. Added a button to open a github profile.
  
**-  Contact**

The contact page shows contact information in case the user wants to get in touch. ThereÂ´s also a contact form that the user can use to send an email in a predetermined format to me, the form validates the user inputs to follow specified conditions, and shows messages for those inputs and for email submition.
